#How github works, cloning, forking, making PRâ€™s, opening issues?
##GitHub:
_GitHub is a best platform to explore new things. GitHub is a best way to connect with the peopl across world and learn new things from them._
##Step1:
** GitHub Forking:**
* after creating own github account we can take someone else data through forking.
* Forking is the best way to extract others data and start working on it.
##Steps to Fork other's data:
* Fork this repo owned by Earth Lab into your GitHub account.
##Step2:
** GitHub Cloning:**
* Once we fork someone's data next step is of cloning. It simply means download the zip file and extract into our desktop.
* After cloning we can create our own directory and add files into it to make it more attractful.
##How to clone
* Write git clone https://gitseries.com
*Clone the fork of your repo, so you can edit the contents locally
* Make edits to your local cloned copy of the repo on your computer
*add, commit and push those edits back to your fork on GitHub
##Step3:
* After adding our own content next step is to send Personal Request.
*PR can be seen as informing others about the changes that we have made in a project or in a branch when we pull request that means we
are requesting others to view the cahnges that we have made and merge it with the master branch.
*Suggest the changes that you made, to be added to the Earth Lab central repo using a pull request.
##Step 4:
** Opening Issues **
* Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests. 
*Any GitHub Enterprise user can create an issue in a public repository where issues have not been disabled. 
*You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request.
##Steps to create an issue
*On GitHub Enterprise, navigate to the main page of the repository.
*Under your repository name, click  Issues.
*Click New issue
*If there are multiple issue types, click Get started next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
*ype a title and description for your issue.
